# Deploy Javelit apps on Railway

We recommend Railway to deploy _standalone_ Javelit apps.

1. Put your app in a public GitHub repo
2. Open the <a href="https://railway.com/new/template/javelit-app?referralCode=NFgD4z" target="_blank">Railway one-click deploy Javelit template</a> 
3. Sign-in if necessary.
4. Paste your GitHub project URL
5. Click Deploy.

That's it! 🚡 You now have a shareable app.

<Tip>
If you need to set your own custom environment variables, Click Deploy first, then edit the deployment to add your variables.
</Tip>

<Note>
Deploying with Railway supports the Javelit project!

The interactive examples in the documentation are hosted on Railway. Deploying your Javelit apps with the <a href="https://railway.com/new/template/javelit-app?referralCode=NFgD4z" target="_blank">Railway template</a> 
sends 25% of your spend back to Javelit to help fund the hosting.  
In most cases, you won't spend a penny, but if you do, part of your spend goes right back into supporting your favorite Java framework!
